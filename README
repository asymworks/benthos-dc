This library provides a plugin-based interface to dive computers and allows
for transfer of dive data and control of the dive computer using device-specific
backend driver plugins.

The core library provides the basic interfaces that plugins must implement as
well as the plugin registry and load/unload functionality.  The library includes
several device plugins and also supports third-party plugins.

Current driver plugins included with benthos_dc are:
- smart: Uwatec Smart device driver

This code is released under a GPL license to be compatible with libdivecomputer.
